according to the [results, rustles] of the research of one english university,
it does not matter in which order the letters are ordered in a word.
it is only important that the first and the last letters be in their places.
all other letters can be ordered in an arbitrary order, and one can still
read the text without any problems. it seems to be due to the fact that we
do not read each letter separately, but read each word as a whole.

this [is, ow, ox] typographic mistake
